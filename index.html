    <h2>unity vs unreal engine vs gamemaker vs gamemaker2 vs godis</h2>
    <h3 id="unity">unity</h3>
    <p>unity is one of the most popoular gameengine for inde developers and foe good reasons <br> because it is so easy to learn it uses c# as its programing language and it user interface is meant to be for beginers so it will be easy and it documention is way easier than unreals documention and is really powerful and it is a freemum program you can get more use out of it if you pay for the program and if you make over 100k a year you have to pay for the lsience</p>
    
    <li>uses c# as it programing language </li>
    <li>user interface is easy to use </li>
    <li>it is freemum and if you make over 100k a year you are forced to pay and has three theirs </li>
    
    <h3>the coding</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>unity uses c# whic is way easier than what unity uses whic is c++ whic is harder   <a href="https://www.upwork.com/resources/c-sharp-vs-c-plus-plus#:~:text=However%2C%20moving%20from%20C%23%20to,learn%20in%20the%20development%20world.">Read why c++ is harder than c#</a> </p> 
    <br>

    <p>now unity is one of the <b>free</b> best 2d game engine you can get but heres the thing gamemakerstudio2 is easier and more powerful than  unity 2d featurs but it is paid and you nly have a trial and if you want to code in lua it is easier than c# and c# featurs a more limiting multiplayer suck on unity and due to the fact that it relies too heavly on it community plugins which you have to pay for  most likey an  example playmaker unreal has visual scripting built in to it but  playmaker cost $65 dollars  on the <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/visual-scripting/playmaker-368">Unity asset store</a> but there are some great free unity plugins but most of them are paid a great free alternitive to playmaker would be <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/visual-scripting/bolt-163802">bolt</a>  which is made by unity themselves but is not included by defult   </p>

    <price>  price:freeimum but pay for if you make over 100k</price>
    
    <h2 id="unreal">Unreal engine</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>this is unity competer</p>
    <p>unreal is more powerful than unity in a lot more wasen't it has a lot of unity features built in with no plugins which costs money and that is why big studios don't use unity because it has worse grapphics and because it has all the featurs that unity is missing in there ansd it is  100% free and unreal 5 even has realtime baked lights whic makes it way easier than unity baked lights ans if you know unreal it become easy asn you will find out how limiting unity is the one disaadvantage is that it only supports 3d and not 2d so if you want to make a 2d game use gamemaker or unity</p>
